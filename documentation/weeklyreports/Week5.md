This week I managed to make a working GUI. I had to change to Tkinter from PySimpleGUI. Now when the program is run it opens a window where parameters can be put. Then the graph is shown in the window and it can be modified usin cellular automata. 

I learned quite a lot about making the GUI as i haven't really done one before. 

Program is quite slow with the GUI, so my next weeks task is to try and make it work a bit faster. 

I used about 15 hours on this project this week
