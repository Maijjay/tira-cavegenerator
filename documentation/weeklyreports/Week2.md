This week I made a code that generates a random graph with given parameters (width, hight and percent of floors). Then is sorts the graph a few times so it looks more like a cave. I used the rules of game of life for the sorting. I also refactored the code to to multiple times.

I also started making the tests but sadly I didn't get very far.

I used about 15 hours on this project this week.

Next week I am going to make an algorithm to search the the biggest cave and remove the rest from the graph. This is probably going to be a deapth search.
