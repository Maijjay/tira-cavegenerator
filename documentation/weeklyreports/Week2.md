This week I made a code that generates a random graph with given parameters (width, hight and percent on floors). Then is sorts the graph a few times so it looks more like a cave. I used the rules os game of life for the sorting.

I used about 12 hours on this project this week.

I also started making the tests but sadly I didn't get very far.

Next week I am going to make an algorithm to search the the biggest cave and remove the rest from the graph. This is probably going to be a deapth search. Also i need to make the tests and refactor the code a bit next week.
