This week I made some tests and wrote the testing document. I also modified the GUI so it is a lot faster now than before(still not very fast). Previously I was making a canvas for each node, but now i managed to make one canvas and draw the nodes in it. This week I also made the peer review. 

I used about 9 on this project this week.

Next I need to make a button for clearing up the canvas, so the program doesn't need a restart if you want to make a new graph. GUI window has some resizing issues that I am going to fix next week. I am going to make the performance tests, when I think this project is nearly done.
