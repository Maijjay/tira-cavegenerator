- WHAT LANGUAGE
I can make peer rewievs using Java or Python

Algorihtms I use:
- Randomgenerator for making the (undirected) graph
- Cellural automata for making the cave from the graph
- Visual representation
- Calculating size of the cave for deleting the smaller, unavailable caves.

I'll be using probably adjacency lists/matrix as a data structure

Procedual generation of caves using cellural automata. Challenge is to make
sure there is always a way out of the cave. Also I need to make sure that the 
generated cave will be big enough and the smaller, unaccessable caves 
will be removed. Also the cave cannot go over the edges of the graph.

- 2D graph of cells. A cell can be either a wall or a floor, using boolean values
- The graph is filled randomly with walls and floors
- the cave is made from the randomly generated graph by applyiong the rules
 of the cellural autamata n-iterations 
- Lastly it's neccesaey to make sure that the is large enough and there is a way out of the cave.
- Smaller, unavailable caves will be removed.

Software will have input to determine the size of the graph and how many iterations 
the cellural autamata will go trough and how many wall cells there will be when initializin the graph.

Space complexity is at least 2(nm)
Expected time will probably be at least p(nm)
