# Project specification

### Topic:
* Procedual generation of caves using cellural automata. Challenge is to make sure the cave 
is big enough and to be sure there is always a way out of the cave. 
Smaller, unaccessable caves will be removed. Also the cave cannot go over the edges of the graph.

### Some steps:
- 2D graph of cells. A cell can be either a wall or a floor, using boolean values
- The graph is filled randomly with walls and floors
- The cave is made from the randomly generated graph by applyiong the rules
of the cellural autamata n-iterations 
- Lastly it's neccesary to make sure that the is large enough and there is a way out of the cave.
- Smaller, unavailable caves will be removed.
- Visual presentation of the generation of the caves.

### Algorihtms and data structures I use:
- Randomgenerator for making the (undirected) graph
- Cellural automata for making the cave from the graph
- Visual representation
- Calculating size of the cave for deleting the smaller, unavailable caves.
- I'll be using probably adjacency lists/matrix as a data structure

### Input:
- Input to determine the size of the grapp
- How many iterations the cellural autamata will go trough
- What is the ratio between the wall and the floor cells when initializing the graph.

### Space complexity and excpected time:
- Space complexity is at least 2(nm)
- Expected time will probably be at least p(nm)

### Other info
- I'll be making this project using Pyhton.
- I can make peer rewievs using Java or Python
- CS bachelor
- Project language: English
