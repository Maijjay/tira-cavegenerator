This week I decided what project I would do and how to do it. 
I researched different algorithms and studied different methods on how to do a cave generator. 

I used about 8 hours for the research and writing the specification document.

I am a little unsure if my project is big enough for this course.

Next I am probably going to start making the random generator for the grapf
