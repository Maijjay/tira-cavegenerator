This week I made a depth first search function that calculates the size of each cave. I also made a seperate search function that calls the DFS to each node that is floor and saves the largest cave as an array of nodes. I refactored the code by removing the Neighgbour class completely. I installed pylint as style check and modified to code to fit it's standards. I made a few more tests and got the coverage report.
I used about 20 hours on this project this week.

Next week I am going to start making the UI and refactor the search function so it doesn't visit the same cave twice.
